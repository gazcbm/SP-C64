                    C64 CHIPS and COMMON SYMPTOMS  
              latest additions and corrections: 2-25-2017

Note: there were at least five different motherboards made for the C64. 
This composite list includes chips used in all board versions except the 
latest C64C 250469 short board. See c64c-ic.txt for that information. 
Note: not all chips are found in all board versions.

U1 	906108-02 (6526) CIA 
     Startup screen normal, but no cursor. No keyboard or control port
access but cartridge works. Partial failure: some keys or joystick 
positions don't work, one character appears ahead of startup cursor or
random characters appear at startup. Blank screen if chip is shorted 
(remove to check) and chip may get hot to the touch. 

U2 	906108-02 (6526) CIA 
     Startup screen normal. No serial or user port access. "File not
found" error when drive accessed. Cartridge works. Characters may show 
as blocks on startup screen. 

U3 	901226-01 BASIC ROM 
     Blank screen w/ border. Cartridge works. 

U4	901227-03 (early -02) KERNAL ROM	
     Blank screen, no border. Most cartridges don't work but a few game
carts (example: CBM Kickman and Jupiter Lander) will work with a normal 
screen because they bypass the Kernal ROM.

U5	901225-01 CHARACTER ROM	
     Normal startup border, but "garbage" characters where startup page
characters should be. Cartridge works. 

U6	2114 SRAM (COLOR RAM)
     Startup screen shows flickering characters with shimmering colors. 
Check also PLA U17.

U7	906107-01 (6510) MPU
     Blank screen, no border. Cartridge doesn't work.

U8	7406 LOGIC CHIP
     Blank screen. Partial failure: drive access problems: drive resets 
but "device not present" error.

U9 THRU U12 & U21 THRU U24  	8 RAM CHIPS (generic 4164 DRAM)
          note: only 2 4464 RAM chips in later C64C boards
     Blank screen, no border. Shorted chips will get warmer than the
other RAM chips. Partial failure: will sometimes produce "garbage"
screen, abnormal number of bytes free or "out of memory" error on
startup screen.

U13	74LS257APC or A or AN but not PC  (may be MOS7708) LOGIC
     Blank screen, less than 38911 bytes free at startup or "garbage"
screen. See U25  Note: MOS77xx series chips have a high failure rate.

U14	74LS258	LOGIC  (may be MOS7709)
     Blank or "garbage" screen, even with diagnostic cart. If IC is 
MOS 77xx type, they are a frequent failure item! 

U15	74LS139	LOGIC
     Blank screen

U16	CD4066 (generic CMOS quad bilateral switch)
     Color problems such as random color "checkerboard" pattern on screen
or no color. 

U17	906114-01 (82S100PLA) PLA
     Blank screen, no border. It can produce colored screen or flashing
color garbage instead of startup screen. It can cause intermittant loss of
cursor, screen freeze and/or program crashes after warmup and it can put
random characters on screen. This chip normally runs hot. It is the most
common chip to fail in the C64 because it runs hot normally, like the SID.

U18  	906112-01 (6581) SID  Note: 8580 SID used in latest C64C
     Normal screen. No sound or garbled sound. Mouse or graphics tablet
pointer stuck or jitters. If shorted, can cause blank or "garbage" screen.
NOTE: computer will work without a SID plugged in (unplug to check). This
chip normally runs hot. Check also capacitor C13 (open).

U19	906109-04 (6567) VIC (PAL version: 6569)	
     Blank screen (may be light or dark) with no border. Sometimes will
produce garbage or "checkerboard" screen, or screen that lacks contrast.
If screen is blank or garbled from bad VIC, "blind" disk commands from
keyboard may still work.

U20	556 LOGIC, TIMER (generates computer and drive reset at powerup)
     Blank screen. Computer will not reset, or RESTORE doesn't work. 
     If disk drive is held in reset, check buffer transistor Q3 for shorts 
     (later C64 boards only, early boards don't buffer reset line)

U25	74LS257APC or AN or A but not PC  (alt MOS7708) LOGIC
     Blank screen, "garbage" screen or less than 38911 bytes at startup. 
See U13 Note: MOS77xx series chips have a high failure rate.

U26	74LS373	LOGIC
     Startup screen has normal border, but characters are scrambled.

U27	74LS08 (or MOS7712) LOGIC
     Normal startup border, but screen full (or nearly) of "garbage" 
characters. 

U28	CD4066 (generic CMOS quad bilateral switch)
     Normal startup screen. Proportional mouse or graphics tablet
doesn't work in one or both control (joystick) ports. 

U29	74LS74 LOGIC, DIVIDER
     Startup screen shows normal characters in multicolored "rainbow".

U30   74LS193 LOGIC, COUNTER

U31	74LS629N (w/ support logic) or 7701/8701  MASTER OSC.  
     Blank white screen, no border. Normal "whine" in nearby AM radio
will be missing if the oscillator is not running. Check also VIC U19

U32	4044 CMOS LOGIC
     No monitor picture, just diagonal lines on screen. 

POWER PACK: 
     Can produce many problems like blank screen (red LED on, dim, or off),
program lock-up, "garbage" screen, hum bars moving on screen, hum in audio,
several bad RAM or other chips, intermittant operation after warmup, etc.
